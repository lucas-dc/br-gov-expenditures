**Brazilian Government Expenses**

This project interacts with the [Brazilian Government's Public API](https://api.portaldatransparencia.gov.br/api-de-dados) (a.k.a. Portal da TransparÃªncia) to fetch data about public expenditures. Expenses can be shown specific for an organ (such as ministries, chamber of deputies, etc.) or categorized by different government branches such as Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary. 

This is a personal project to practice software architecture patterns, full-stack development, and is not intended for production or as a formal system, but a way to explore and practice various technologies.

 - Fetches data from the Brazilian Government's API to show public spending;
 - Categorizes expenditures by government branches: Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary;
 - Uses Redis for caching API calls to minimize the load on the external service and improve performance;
 - Can be run on-premise or containerized using Docker.

 - Backend: Spring Boot (Java)
 - Frontend: React.js
 - Caching: Redis (using Lettuce)
 - Containerization: Docker
 - Database: MySQL
